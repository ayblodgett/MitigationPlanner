# FFXIV Mitigation Planner

A utility for planning mitigations in FFXIV encounters. Drag and drop abilities onto a timeline and get a visual representation of their durations and cooldowns -- no spreadsheets or doing timestamp math in your head. Save plans locally, or import/export them.

Currently work-in-progress; latest version deployed [here](https://ayblodgett.github.io/MitigationPlanner/) for preview! Current issues, to-dos, and future plans tracked [here](https://github.com/ayblodgett/MitigationPlanner/issues/1).
